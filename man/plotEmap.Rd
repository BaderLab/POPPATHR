\title{Create EnrichmentMap in Cytoscape to visualize selection-enriched pathways}
\usage{
plotEmap(gmtF, resF, netName = "generic", outDir, imageFormat = "png",
  verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gmtF}{(char) file path to GMT file (this needs to be absolute path name).}

\item{resF}{(list) file paths to results_forEM.txt for each population comparison
(generated by setupGSEA_run.R).}

\item{netName}{(char) name for network in Cytoscape.}

\item{outDir}{(char) path to directory where file should be stored.}

\item{imageFormat}{(char) one of PNG, PDF, SVG, or JPEG.}

\item{verbose}{(logical) print messages.

# not run because requires Cytoscape to be installed and open
# plotEmap(gmtFile = gmtF, nodeAttrFile = nodeAttrFile, netName="HighRisk",
# outDir=outDir).}
}
\value{
Filename of image to which EnrichmentMap is exported. Also side
		effect of plotting the EnrichmentMap in an open session of Cytoscape.
}
\description{
Create a network where nodes are pathway gene sets significantly
	enriched in two independent population-based GSEA (i.e., validated
		selection-enriched gene sets.) Pathways are then clustered to identify
	main pathways and themes of the selection-enriched gene sets.
